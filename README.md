# Drawing Compare
This is a simple python code to compare two drawings. It converts the drawings in image and compares the images pixel by pixel and highlights the difference.

Problem Description:
 - In OEMs like automobile companies, for every part an engineering drawing is created. Engineering drawing has all the important dimensions, material, surface treatment details etc. of the part. Every engineering drawing is released by the part designer in the system. That released engineering drawing is reffered by the manufacturere/supplier to make the part. Due to field issues or MFG comments, the engineering drawing goes through modifications and it's modified version is again released in the system by the designer.
- On an average there are 100+ parts under the ownership of a designer, and these parts continuously undergo modification as per the requirement. For each modification a drawing is prepared which has to be chekced throughly before release by the designer.
- This simple python code minimizes the checking time of the engineering drawing.

Input:
Two engineering drawings. (old and modified)

Output:
One image highlighting the differece between old and modified drawing.

Impact:
1) Increases productivity.
2) Reduces the drawing checking time by 90%
